#   move implies cddb,read,encode,tag
#   playlist implies cddb
# An action can be added to the "default" action by specifying it along with
# "default", without having to repeat the default ones:
#  ACTIONS=default,playlist
# The default action list (referenced as "default") is defined in the following
# comment:
ACTIONS=cddb,read,encode,tag,move,clean

# CD device you want to read from
# It can be defined as a singletrack flac file, but since it might change from

# You have the following variables at your disposal:

# Make sure to single-quote this variable. abcde will automatically create

# Set the playlist file location format. Uses the same variables and format

# Custom filename munging:
# By default, abcde will do the following to CDDB data to get a useful
# filename:
# * Translate colons to a space and a dash for Windows compatibility
# * Eat control characters, single quotes, and question marks
# * Translate spaces and forward slashes to underscores
# To change that, redefine the mungefilename function.
# mungefilename receives the CDDB data (artist, track, title, whatever)
# as $1 and outputs it on stdout.
#mungefilename ()

# Uppercase.

# * Set the CD speed. You can also use the built-in options, but you can also 
#   set it here. In Debian, eject -x and cdset -x do the job.
# KEEP IN MIND that executables included in pre_read must be in your $PATH or
# you have to define them with full /path/to/binary
# Uncomment and substitute the ":" with your commands.

# Custom post-read function
